# To-Do-List-Web-Application

Features:

- The user can create a new account and log in/out.
- The user can create a new task for themselves.
- The user can set a priority level for their tasks.
- The tasks will be ordered based on their priority.
- The user may mark a task as 'done', therefore moving it to a 'Completed Tasks' list
- The user can comment on their tasks (Description)

These are the basic features that I've implemented so far.
I'm not sure if I'm yet satisfied with the scope of the project,
so more features will have to be added.

Some ideas for more features:

- Users can befriend each other, allowing them to see each others tasks
- User roles..?(Although I'm not sure how useful those would be in this app)
- Group tasks

TODO!

- Improve the overall look and design of the UI.
