# To-Do-List-Web-Application

Features:

- The user can create a new account and log in/out.
- The user can create a new task for themselves.
- The user can set a priority level for their tasks.
- The tasks will be ordered based on their priority.
- The user may mark a task as 'done', therefore moving it to a 'Completed Tasks' list

These are the basic features that I have in mind at the moment. I recognize the need for more SQL tables, so more features need to be added.

Some ideas:

- The user can comment on their tasks after they have been created (keeping track of their progress on that specific task).
- A guest profile that only allows them to view the tasks created by the user..?
